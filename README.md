# Pong

## About
This is my attempt to recreate the classic arcade game [*Pong*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiShX2pTz9A) using C++. This is a single player version, where the player is against a simple AI-controlled paddle.  

This was my first game project after learning the fundamentals of C++, so the main goal was just to learn how to write simple games using the language.
